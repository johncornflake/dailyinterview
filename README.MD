### A repo for my solutions to daily interview questions.

Questions via https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/
Files named by date the problems were sent and the email title.
Everything solved using python3.

#### Importer from Gmail

This is a stupid gmail importer I'm currently working on. It scans your gmail
via api and searches for the daily interview emails, then drop them in an imported
folder so you can work on them with the file made and email description of the
problem already in the file.

# Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Google:
#
# You are given an array of tuples (start, end) representing time intervals for lectures. The intervals may be overlapping. Return the number of rooms that are required.
#
# For example. [(30, 75), (0, 50), (60, 150)] should return 2.

def roomsNeeded(times):
    pass

t = [(30, 75), (0, 50), (60, 150)]


print(t[0] in range(t[1]));
res = []
for tr in t:
    c = 0

Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Google:

By the way, check out our NEW project AlgoPro (
http://algopro.com
) for over 60+ video coding sessions
with ex-Google/ex-Facebook engineers.


A look-and-say sequence is defined as the integer sequence beginning with a single digit in which the next term is obtained by describing the previous term.  An example is easier to understand:
Each consecutive value describes the prior value.
1
      

#
11
     

# one 1's
21
     

# two 1's
1211
   

# one 2, and one 1.
111221
 

# 
#one 1, one 2, and two 1's.
Your task is, return the 
nth
 term of this sequence.

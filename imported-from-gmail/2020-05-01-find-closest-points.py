Hi, here's your problem today. (You've reached the end of the problems for now - in the meanwhile, here is a random question. And visit

 for more practice!) This problem was recently asked by LinkedIn:


Given a list of points as a tuple 
(x, y)
 and an integer 
k
, find the 
k
 closest points to the origin 
(0, 0)
.
Here's an example and some starter code:
def
 
closest_points
(
points
,
 
k
):
  

# Fill this in.
print
(
closest_points
([(
0
,
 
0
),
 
(
1
,
 
2
),
 
(
-
3
,
 
4
),
 
(
3
,
 
1
)],
 
2
))

# [(1, 2), (0, 0)]

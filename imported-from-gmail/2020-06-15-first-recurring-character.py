Hi, here's your problem today. (You've reached the end of the problems for now - in the meanwhile, here is a random question. And visit

 for more practice!) This problem was recently asked by Amazon:


Given a string, return the first recurring letter that appears. If there are no recurring letters, return 
None
.
Example:
Input: qwertty
Output: t
Input: qwerty
Output: None
Here's some starter code:
def
 
first_recurring_char
(
s
):
  

# Fill this in.
  
print
(
first_recurring_char
(
'qwertty'
))

# t
print
(
first_recurring_char
(
'qwerty'
))

# None

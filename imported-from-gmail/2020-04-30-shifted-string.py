Hi, here's your problem today. (You've reached the end of the problems for now - in the meanwhile, here is a random question. And visit 
CoderPro
 for more practice!) This problem was recently asked by Apple:


You are given two strings, A and B. Return whether A can be shifted some number of times to get B.
Eg. A = abcde, B = cdeab should return true because A can be shifted 3 times to the right to get B. A = abc and B= acb should return false.
def
 
is_shifted
(
a
,
 
b
):
  

# Fill this in.
  
print
 
is_shifted
(
'abcde'
,
 
'cdeab'
)

# True

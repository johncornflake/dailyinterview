Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Apple:


In many spreadsheet applications, the columns are marked with letters. From the 1st to the 26th column the letters are 
A
 to 
Z
. Then starting from the 27th column it uses 
AA
, 
AB
, ..., 
ZZ
, 
AAA
, etc.
Given a number 
n
, find the 
n
-th column name.
def
 
column_name
(
n
):
  

# Fill this in.
print
 
column_name
(
26
)
print
 
column_name
(
27
)
print
 
column_name
(
28
)

# Z

# AA

# AB

Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Amazon:


Version numbers are strings that are used to identify unique states of software products. A version number is in the format a.b.c.d. and so on where a, b, etc. are numeric strings separated by dots. These generally represent a hierarchy from major to minor changes. Given two version numbers 
version1
 and 
version2
, conclude which is the latest version number. Your code should do the following: 
If 
version1 > version2
 return 
1
. 
If 
version1 < version2
 return 
-1
.
Otherwise return 
0
. 
Note that the numeric strings such as a, b, c, d, etc. may have leading zeroes, and that the version strings do not start or end with dots. Unspecified level revision numbers default to 0.
Example
: 
Input
: 
version1 = "1.0.33"
version2 = "1.0.27"
Output
: 1 

#version1 > version2
Input
:
version1 = "0.1"
version2 = "1.1"
Output
: -1

#version1 < version2
Input
: 
version1 = "1.01"
version2 = "1.001"
Output
: 0

#ignore leading zeroes, 01 and 001 represent the same number. 
Input
:
version1 = "1.0"
version2 = "1.0.0"
Output
: 0

#version1 does not have a 3rd level revision number, which
defaults to "0"
Here's a starting point
class
 
Solution
:
  
def
 
compareVersion
(
self
,
 
version1
,
 
version2
):
    

# Fill this in.
version1
 
=
 
"1.0.1"
version2
 
=
 
"1"
print
(
Solution
()
.
compareVersion
(
version1
,
 
version2
))

# 1

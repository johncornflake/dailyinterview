Hi, here's your problem today. (You've reached the end of the problems for now - in the meanwhile, here is a random question. And visit

 for more practice!) This problem was recently asked by Microsoft:


Return the longest run of 1s for a given integer 
n
's binary representation.
Example:
Input: 242
Output: 4
242 in binary is 
0b11110010
, so the longest run of 1 is 4.
def
 
longest_run
(
n
):
  

# Fill this in.
print
 
longest_run
(
242
)

# 4

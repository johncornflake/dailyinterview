Hi, here's your problem today. (You've reached the end of the problems for now - in the meanwhile, here is a random question. And visit 
CoderPro
 for more practice!) This problem was recently asked by Apple:


Given a non-negative integer 
n
, convert 
n
 to base 2 in string form. Do not use any built in base 2 conversion functions like 
bin
.
Here's an example and some starter code:
def
 
base_2
(
n
):
  

# Fill this in.
print
(
base_2
(
123
))

# 1111011
In the above example, 
2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 123
.
